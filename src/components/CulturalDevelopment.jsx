      About the Program
    </h3>
    <p className="text-gray-600">
      The Cultural Development Program of Shantibari takes pride in its
      commitment to women’s empowerment through various cultural
      initiatives. Regular cultural events specifically dedicated to
      women are organized, providing a platform for talented women to
      showcase their skills and artistic talents. These events not only
      celebrate women’s creativity but also encourage their active
      participation in the cultural life of the community. Additionally,
      Shantibari’s art gallery offers opportunities for women
      photographers and artists to exhibit their works, giving them the
      exposure they deserve. The program also boasts an open space where
      film shows are arranged, allowing women filmmakers to screen the
      films they create, fostering a supportive and encouraging
      environment for women in the film industry. By promoting gender
      equality and providing avenues for women to express themselves
      artistically, the Cultural Development Program of Shantibari
      contributes significantly to the cultural vibrancy and diversity
      of the region.
